# TheGamingRoom

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Over the course of the class, I had to design software that would run and manage multiple instances of a game. 
The client was The Gaming Room, a game-develop firm. Our game was called Draw It Or Lose It! and ran on HTML, CSS & Javascript. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job justifying my decisions when making important decisions regarding the game platform's architecture. All of my suggestions are well-supported and well-defended.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that working through a design document allowed me to more intuitively understand the larger picture when writing the code - knowing exaclty how each piece of the program fits together was helpful in minimizing backtracking. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would go back and revise the final portion of the document, the suggestions. I was a little late in submitting the assignment so that section was more rushed than I like. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the user's stated needs to make important design decisions, such as what kind of encryption we should use. The user is ultimately the reason the software is being developed to begin with, so its critical that all decisions start and end with their necessities taken into consideration. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached software design by keeping the larger picture and desired functionality of the program in my mind and working backwards from there. I would apply this strategy in future development endeavors.
